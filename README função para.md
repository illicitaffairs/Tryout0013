Just codes I've been working on 
This code defines a function called calcular_constante_elastica() that calculates the spring constant. Here's how the code works:

The function calcular_constante_elastica() is defined without any parameters.

Inside the function, the user is prompted to enter the applied force (f) in Newtons and the deformation of the spring (x) in meters. The input() function is used to read user input, and the float() function is used to convert the input to a floating-point number.

The spring constant (k) is calculated by dividing the applied force (f) by the deformation of the spring (x).

The result is then printed using the print() function, which displays the calculated spring constant (k) along with the unit "N/m" (Newtons per meter).

Finally, the function calcular_constante_elastica() is called, which executes the code inside the function.

To use this code, you can simply run it, and it will prompt you to enter the force and deformation values. After entering the values, it will calculate and display the spring constant.
